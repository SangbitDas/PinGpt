# ChatGPT Chat Pinner

A Chrome extension to save and organize your important ChatGPT conversations.

## Why We Built This

ChatGPT doesn't provide a way to bookmark or save specific conversations for quick access. As your chat history grows, finding important conversations becomes tedious. This extension lets you **pin chats directly from ChatGPT** and access them anytime through the extension.

## Impact

- **Never Lose Important Chats**: Save conversations you want to revisit without scrolling through history.
- **Organized Access**: Group pinned chats into custom categories for better management.
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Pins sync across all your Chrome browsers via Chrome sync storage.
- **One-Click Access**: Open any saved chat instantly from the extension popup or full page view.

## Features

- 📌 **Pin from Context Menu** — Use ChatGPT's three-dot menu to pin any conversation.
- 📁 **Custom Categories** — Create categories (e.g., "Work", "Research") to organize pins.
- 🔍 **Search & Filter** — Find pinned chats by name or filter by category.
- 📋 **Full Page View** — Dedicated management page for all pinned chats.
